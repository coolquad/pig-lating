Design a program to take a word as an input, and then encode it into a Pig Latin. A Pig Latin is an encrypted word in English, which is generated by doing following alterations:

Encode words that begin with a consonant sound from english to pig latin.
    For words that begin with consonant sounds, all letters before the initial vowel 
    are placed at the end of the word sequence, preceded by a hyphen "-". Then, "ay" is added.
